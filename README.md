### **Introduction**

#### **What is a loop?**

A loop is a chunk of code that executes repeatedly when a condition is met. They're very useful when working with arrays and objects! It's a great way to make your code more efficient (if done correctly). 

### **Types Of Loops**

#### **While Loops**

"While" loop evaluates the condition at the start of every iteration. Make sure that the condition eventually goes false!! You don't want this to loop forever.

#### **For Loops**

The "For" loop is the most common loop that's used and is typically used to run the code a certain number of times.

## **ðŸš€ About Me**
I graduated from i.c.stars |* Milwaukee summer of 2019, Cycle 3. I wore many hats as an intern -- project manager, technical analyst, and scrum master. Leading my team as the primary developer, we were selected as the winners of Cycle 3's sponsor project. It led to us presenting it in front of C-level executives at an event called iOpener at the end of that same year.

Continuing my passion in technology, I found myself working for MacGregor Partners. Working my way up, I'm now a Sr. Software Engineer for MacGregor Partners (Aquired by Accenture) and considered the resident expert at ExtJS! Current techstack: ExtJS, ReactJS, AngularJS, MOCA, MS SQL, C, `and Java.
